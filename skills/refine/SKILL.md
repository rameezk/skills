# Refine

Question the user hard, and keep going until both of you actually agree on what gets built. Hold off on any implementation until that agreement is explicit.

## How it works

Treat the plan as a **design tree**: each choice opens up the smaller choices that sit beneath it. Walk down every branch so nothing important is left to assumption.

Move through the tree in **rounds**, guided by the **frontier** - the set of choices whose inputs are already decided, so you can raise them now without second-guessing answers you don't have yet. Put the entire frontier to the user in a single round, then hold for their replies before continuing. If a question hinges on another that's still unanswered this round, save it for a later one.

Every set of answers redraws the tree: resolved choices extend the frontier and open up whatever was waiting on them. Rebuild the frontier from there and run the next round.

## Round format

Number the questions and lead each with the answer you'd pick, so the user can sign off with a single word.

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, may run several paragraphs, including options>

💡 <the answer you'd pick>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body>

💡 <the answer you'd pick>
```

## Finding facts

Digging up facts is on you, not the user. When a question turns on something in the environment - a file, a config value, an installed dependency, how some code behaves - send a subagent to find out rather than asking the user for what you could check yourself.

Don't stall the round waiting on it. An in-flight lookup is just another unresolved input, so only the questions that depend on its result wait; raise the rest of the frontier right away.

## Completion

The calls belong to the user: surface each one and wait for it. You're finished when the frontier runs dry - every branch of the tree walked, nothing quietly assumed.

Refining is not building. When the frontier runs dry, stop. Summarize the agreed plan and hand it back - do not start implementing, and do not ask "shall I build it now?" as a way to keep going. Reaching shared understanding is the end of this skill, not a checkpoint on the way to writing code. Implementation happens only when the user comes back and explicitly asks for it in a separate step.
